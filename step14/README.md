Thus, the workshop is ended. Of course, the database turned out to be very simple, but I hope this was useful for you. Where to move further?

For example, you can make an implementation on lock-free algorithms, you can look at the code `redis` or `memcache`. I hope you learned something new for yourself.

As a homework, let you write some tests for these four API methods. This [guide](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/testing) will help you. You can perform it in the auditorium.
